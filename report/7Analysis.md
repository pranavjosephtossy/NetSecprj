Testing pfsense showed that the firewall applies rules consistently and behaved exactly as expected under each setup. ICMP was a useful protocol for testing because there were no other services like SSH or HTTP running on the target vm so it made the results clearer. When ICMP echo requests were blocked, all ping attempts to the LAN interface stopped immediately. This confirmed that pfsense was correctly enforcing protocol specific firewall rules top to bottom, as placing an allow rules above the block rule restored connectivity straight away. 

the traffic policy tests were also straightforward and predictable. witha default allow configuration, outbound traffic worked normally. when it was canged to default deny, all traffic was blocked until specific allow rules were added. the logging feature made it easy to see ehat was being permitted or denied. overall, pfsense proved to be stable, easy to manage and effevtive for testing core forewall functionality.

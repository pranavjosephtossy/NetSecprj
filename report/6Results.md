Nftables produced a clear and consistent results across all four major test categories. Port-filtering rules behaved as expected. Because the tvm was not configured to run a web server or provide SSH access, i could not demonstrate these services functioning. However, applying the same logic using ICMP by permiting or blocking ping produced a similar expected showcase of rule behaviour. In figure you can see that while the ping does work and the ssh port(22) is filtered, meaning the firewall has xxx.
The protocol blocking test of ICMP messages accuratetly dropped ping request like it was configured. Traffic-policy testing proved expected behaviour under default-allow and default-deny configurations. Logging tests od allowed and dropped traffic provided detailed entries into the system journal. Overall each ruleset behaved as expected and produced the desierable output.

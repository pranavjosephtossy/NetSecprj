PfSense passed with flying colors. the the basline test, the TVM was able to successfully ping the firewall using ICMP, which confirmed that the LAN interface was set up and working properly. Once an ICMP b;pck rule was applied on the LAN interface, all ping attempts t0 192.168.20.1 failed straight away. this shows that pfSense was correctly enforcing protocol-specific firewall rules. when an allow rule was placed above the block rule, connectivity was restored, demonstrating how pfsense processes rules top to bottom. The traffic policy tests also behaved as expected. with default allow settings, the VM could access external addresses without issues however switching to a default deny policy immediately blocked outbound traffic until specific allow rules were configured. this highlighted how easily pfsense can shift between open and restrivtive security configurations. the system logs also recorded detailed informtaion for both allowed and blocked traffic, providing clear evidence that each firewall rule was functioning as intended.

Nftables produced a clear and consistent results across all four major test categories. Port-filtering rules behaved as expected. Because the tvm was not configured to run a web server or provide SSH access, i could not demonstrate these services functioning. However, applying the same logic using ICMP by permiting or blocking ping produced a similar expected showcase of rule behaviour. In figure you can see that while the ping does work and the ssh port(22) is filtered, meaning the firewall has xxx.
The protocol blocking test of ICMP messages accuratetly dropped ping request like it was configured. Traffic-policy testing proved expected behaviour under default-allow and default-deny configurations. Logging tests od allowed and dropped traffic provided detailed entries into the system journal. Overall each ruleset behaved as expected and produced the desierable output.

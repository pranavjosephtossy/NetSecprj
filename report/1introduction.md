# Introduction(250)

    The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate how selected opensource firewalls operate within a controlled and consistend test environment. Firewalls remains as a foundational aspect of network security, by acting as the first line of defence. While relying exclusively on firewalls for security is not recomanded, it is still a crucial aspect, acting as an important layers in a good multi layered security network. 

    Businesses and organisations incriisingly rely on opensourse firewalls as the offer a great level of flexibility and compatability within an organizations infrasturcure. It is also extreamly cost effective. Understanding their limitations and operations are very relevant with setting up a secure network.

    The three selected opensource firewalls are: endian, nftables and pfsense. 
    
    Comparing firewalls are offer valuable information regarding their limitations and and effectiveness within different networks.

    This report will brieflt explain each firewalls basic operation. Then will explain the test environment set up to compare each one. Then show how to configure each firewall within said network topology. There is a test plan that will be used to evaluate how each firewall performs after which the results will be analysed and a conclusion drawn on each firewalls strengths and limitations.
